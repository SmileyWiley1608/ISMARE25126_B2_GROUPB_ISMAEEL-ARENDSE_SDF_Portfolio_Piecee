## **2. Technical Breakdown**

### **A. Tailwind CSS Setup**

- Used **Tailwind CSS via CDN** for quick prototyping.
- Customized the theme in the `<script>` section:
  ```html
  <script>
    tailwind.config = {
      theme: {
        extend: {
          fontFamily: { poppins: ["Poppins", "sans-serif"] },
          colors: {
            primary: "#2c3e50",
            secondary: "#3498db",
            customOrange: "#D76239",
          },
          borderRadius: { custom: "29.042px" },
        },
      },
    };
  </script>
  ```
- This allowed me to define **custom colors, fonts, and rounded corners** for consistency.

### **B. Layout & Responsiveness**

- **Mobile-First Approach**:
  - Used `flex` and `grid` layouts with `sm:`, `md:`, and `lg:` breakpoints.
  - Example:
    ```html
    <div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6">
      <!-- Content adjusts based on screen size -->
    </div>
    ```
- **Two-Column Desktop Layout**:
  - Left column: **Proficiency, Projects, Experience**
  - Right column: **Skills, Tools, Education, Contact**

### **C. Key Components**

#### **1. Proficiency Section (Skill Bars)**

- Used **flex and custom progress bars** to visualize skill levels:
  ```html
  <div class="w-full bg-gray-200 rounded-full h-3">
    <div
      class="h-full rounded-full"
      style="width: 90%; background-color: #36966e"
    ></div>
  </div>
  ```
  - Shows **HTML (90%)**, **CSS (70%)**, **Tailwind (60%)**, and **Node.js (40%)**.

#### **2. Project Cards**

- Two styled cards:
  - **Green card** (current project)
  - **White card** (future project)
- Each includes:
  - **Brief description**
  - **Technologies used**
  - **My responsibilities**

#### **3. Experience Timeline**

- **"Most Recent" tag** for the latest job.
- Bullet-point responsibilities for clarity.

#### **4. Skills Grid**

- Responsive grid layout:
  ```html
  <div class="skill-grid">
    <div class="skill-cell">Efficient</div>
    <div class="skill-cell">Agile</div>
    <!-- More skills... -->
  </div>
  ```
  - Adjusts columns based on screen size.

#### **5. Contact Section**

- **Call-to-action** in orange.
- Links to **email, phone, LinkedIn, and GitHub**.
